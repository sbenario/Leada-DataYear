This problem set features data from the United States Department of Transportation on Airline On-Time Statistics and Delay Causes.

###Instructions:
We will only work with the first million rows. Download year 2008.

**Problem 1:** Find the IATA code that is in the Origin column, but is NOT is the Dest column.


**Problem 2:**  Which airport, as defined by the IATA code, has at least 10,000 flights and had the lowest probability for a delayed flight in the data?


_Define a delay as:_

	If ArrDelay > 0, then count as a delayed flight to Origin airport.  
	If DepDelay > 0, then count as a delayed flight to Dest airport.  
	Total delayed flights equals the sum of the two above.  
	Probability of delay equals total delayed flights divided by total flights (Origin & Dest) that go through that airport.  


**Problem 3:**  
Create a spreadsheet of data which calculates the historical probability of flight delay in each of the twenty carriers based off of two characteristics.  

	1. DayofWeek - Weekday (1,2,3,4,5) or Weekend (6,7)  
	2. DepTime - Day Time (0501 to 1700), Night Time (1701 to 2400), or Red Eye (0000 to 0500)  
	3. UniqueCarrier - Carrier (20)  

	For example, for an AA day time flight on the weekday, the percentage of delayed flights was ~29.3%.
